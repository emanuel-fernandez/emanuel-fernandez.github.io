# Emanuel Fern√°ndez - Software developer

## About me
I like to tackle new challenges, incorporate new technologies and provide good solutions to problems. I am self-critical
and I am always willing to get feedback to progress professionally. Although I have been mainly inclined towards
Backend development, I have learned different technologies to be able to provide full systems.
